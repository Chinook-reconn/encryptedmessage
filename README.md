Unlike traditional messaging apps or email, where data travels across multiple servers or devices, this platform works differently — and more privately.

Messages do not circle around the internet. They are stored on the same secure server where the platform runs. When you send a message, it stays in one place — the server you're connected to. The recipient connects to the same system to retrieve and decrypt it.

Think of it like a luggage locker at a train station:

    You place your message in a secure box and lock it with your encryption key.
    You cannot open it again — only the intended recipient can unlock and read it using their private key.
    The message doesn’t “travel” anywhere. It stays in that locked box until it’s picked up.

This model ensures your messages don’t bounce between servers or third parties, and can only be decrypted by the person they’re meant for — no one else.

You can send messages to yourself — and yes, it's intentional.

If you enter your own nickname as the recipient, the message will be encrypted and delivered just like any other message. This effectively turns the platform into a secure, built-in encrypted notes system. It's perfect for saving personal thoughts, reminders, or sensitive data — all accessible only by you.

Messages on this platform are encrypted one-way, meaning only the intended recipient can decrypt and read the message. So when you send a message to yourself, you are the only person who holds the key to decrypt it. Even the system cannot access its content.

This is not a bug or workaround — it's a privacy-first feature, designed to give you secure space for your own encrypted information. Your self-addressed messages remain encrypted and completely under your control.
